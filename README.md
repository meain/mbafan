# mbafan

You might have had issues with Linux installation on your Macbook Air that it is getting hot and that the fans are not kicking in.
Well, this provides a sort of solution to that problem by checking the core temp and varying the fan speeds accordingly.

No guarantee, but it should probably work. It won't probably blow up your system at least.

** If the system still gets hot, please report an issue I'll see if I can help. **

Do keep in mind:
* Its written in python, should have done it C
* Not foolproof

My system: `x86_64 Linux 4.10.8-1-ARCH` `Macbook Air7,2`

## Installation instructions
```sh
git clone https://github.com/meain/mbafan.git && cd mbpfan && chmod +x install && ./install.sh && cd ..
```
